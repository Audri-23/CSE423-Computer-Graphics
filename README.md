# Infinite Road Traffic Survival Simulator

Project Description: 3D Infinite Traffic Survival Simulator is a real-time 3D simulation game developed using Python OpenGL. The project demonstrates an endless road environment where the player controls a car that moves continuously forward while avoiding obstacles with dynamically generated traffic vehicles. The illusion of an infinite road is achieved through coordinate recycling rather than dynamic geometry creation. The simulator includes multiple gameplay features such as lane-based movement, speed control, collision detection, cheat mode, score tracking, pause/resume functionality, and multiple camera views. Controllable traffic vehicles exhibit randomized behavior, increasing difficulty over time. The project emphasizes core computer graphics concepts including 3D transformations, camera manipulation, real-time animation, and interaction handling, making it a comprehensive demonstration of OpenGL-based 3D simulation.

The project incorporates real-time keyboard and mouse input handling to allow interactive control of the simulation. Keyboard inputs are used to manage vehicle movement, speed adjustment, camera switching, game state control, and cheat mode activation, while mouse inputs support camera mode toggling and interaction feedback. From a technical and academic perspective, the project demonstrates a strong understanding of 3D transformations, coordinate systems, camera modeling, and real-time simulation logic using basic OpenGL functions.
